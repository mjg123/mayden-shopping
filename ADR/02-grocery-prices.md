# Grocery Prices

## Status

accepted

## Context

Stories 7 and 8 in the original plan relate to grocery prices:
 - Story 7: Total up the prices
 - Story 8: Put a spending limit in place, alert me if I go over the limit

We do not have any source for this pricing information. I did not find any official API for
UK grocery prices. Those that do exist (unofficially) seem to use screen-scraping which is legally dubious.
Furthermore prices for the same item may vary by location, temporary sales offers, seasonality, online or IRL shopping, etc.

## Decision

 - Will not be implementing these stories.
 - Will not be implementing any placeholder fields or UI (this can be added when needed)

## Consequences

No prices will be shown or calculated in the demo.
